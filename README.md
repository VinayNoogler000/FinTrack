## üìñ Overview

FinTrack is a user-friendly web application designed to help you manage your finances effortlessly. With FinTrack, you can:

- Add and categorize your earnings and expenses.
- View your current balance and transaction history.
- Easily manage and edit your financial transactions.

Whether you are looking to keep track of your daily expenses or manage your monthly budget, FinTrack provides a simple and effective solution.

## üé• Demo

![FinTrack App](https://github.com/VinayNoogler000/FinTrack/blob/main/assets/Demo.gif?raw=true)

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and functionality to the web application.
- **UUID**: A library to generate unique identifiers for each transaction.
- **SweetAlert**: A library for creating beautiful and customizable alert boxes.

## üöÄ Features

- Add and categorize earnings and expenses.
- View current balance and transaction history.
- Edit and delete transactions.
- Stylish confirmation dialog boxes using SweetAlert.
- Save transactions locally using `localStorage`.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Unique identifiers for each transaction using UUID.

## üìÖ Planned Features

1. Add a feature to ask the user whether they want to save the transactions locally in the browser or not, using `swal` library confirmation box when the user has added their first transaction.
2. Implement backend using Express.js and RESTful APIs.
3. Build a 'Search' transactions feature to filter transactions based on source, amount, or type of transactions.
4. Implement a feature to add the date of the transaction.
5. Add a feature where the present month will be the default month for adding transactions.
6. Build functionality to generate monthly income/P&L statements in PDF format, allowing the user to select the month.
7. Implement user authentication.
8. Add a feature to add and edit notes for each transaction.

## üìö Learnings

Throughout the development of FinTrack, several key learnings and insights were gained:

1. **Submit Event's submitter property**: Leveraged the submitter property in the event handler to access the button that submitted the form, enhancing form handling capabilities.
2. **Skypack CDN**: Utilized Skypack CDN service for importing and using NPM packages, such as the SweetAlert library, directly into the browser as ES modules.
3. **SweetAlert Library**: Implemented SweetAlert for displaying stylish confirmation dialog boxes, particularly for user confirmation on transaction deletion.
4. **localStorage API**: Gained a deep understanding of the `localStorage` API, its key features, and methods for manipulating data within localStorage.
5. **DOM Events**: Differentiated between `window` object's `load` and `DOMContentLoaded` events, optimizing event handling.
6. **Troubleshooting ES6 Modules**: Addressed issues related to importing NPM packages as ES6 modules due to incorrect references, improving module management.
7. **Custom Scrollbar Styling**: Applied custom scrollbar styling in webkit-based browsers using the `-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-element, setting the width to 0px for a cleaner UI.

These learnings contributed significantly to the robustness and user experience of the FinTrack application.

## üóìÔ∏è What My Daily Life Looks Like?
As of now (latest version of this README file), I'm building Projects using Web Devlopement technologies to strengthen my fundamentals, in both Frontend & Backend, thriving to become a Full-Stack Web Developer, while learning Backend Web Development. 

This project/website is my 8th self-made Frontend project (previous one was [QR-Code Generator](https://github.com/VinayNoogler000/QR-Code-Generator)), which was made to strengthen my Frontend Web Development Skills. Also, I've planned to make this a Full-Stack Web App.

In Frontend Web Development, as of now, two more projects are left "Password Generator" and "Mobile Navigation Menu" (means, total 10 projects) to master or specialize in JavaScript.

After, that I will be building atleast 3-5 major Projects using React.js framework with Redux.js library, while learning Backend Web Development.

At last, after Completing Frontend Development Projects, and Learning Backend Development, I'll be making atleast 3 Major Full-Stack Projects, using MERN tech-stack.
