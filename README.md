# Project In Development:

## Learnings:

1. Submit Event's submitter property in the event handler, to access the button which submitted the form.
2. Skypack CDN service for easily importing and using NPM packages--like UUID library--into the browser, as ES modules.
3. SweetAlert library for displaying stylish confirmation dialog boxes, which I specifically used to get confirmation from the user, whether or not to delete the transaction.
