# Project In Development:

## Learnings:

1. Submit Event's submitter property in the event handler, to access the button which submitted the form.
2. Skypack CDN service for easily importing and using NPM packages--like UUID library--into the browser, as ES modules.
3. SweetAlert library for displaying stylish confirmation dialog boxes, which I specifically used to get confirmation from the user, whether or not to delete the transaction. 

## To-Do:
1. Implement a feature to store all the user's transaction locally, in their browsers, by using `localStorage API` so that  when they revisit the website, their past transactions will be accessible, instead of a blank transactions-section.
2. Implement Backend by using Express.js and RESTful APIs.
3. Build 'Search' transactions feature, which will filter transactions, based on source, amount or type of transactions.
4. Implement a feature to add the date of transaction.
5. Add a feature in which the present month will be the month for which transactions are added in the app.
6. Build a functionality to generate monthly income/P&L statement in PDF format, and the user can decide the monthl for which he/she want the statement.
7. Implement User Authentication.
